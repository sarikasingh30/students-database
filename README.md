## About 

Create a form that accepts Student's Name, number and city on index.html
Accept the values and create a Student Constructor function to create a student object.

All the created objects will be pushed into an Array.
This Array will be stored into LocalStorage.

Retrieve the students array back from LocalStorage.
Show each student details on DOM.
Feel free to style in your own way :)
